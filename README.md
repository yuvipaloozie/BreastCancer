# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis
(Yes, I know this is one of the most basic, generic data sets to work with and is part of every beginner ML training bootcamp)

Created a simple Jupyter Notebook that walks through full scale analysis of the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic), including
* Exploratory data analysis
* Univariate/Bivariate analysis
* Visualization w/ Seaborn
* Dimensionality Reduction w/ PCA
* Traoning multiple ML classifiers
* Hyperparameter Tuning
